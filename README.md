# Python Data Analysis: NumPy & Pandas Foundations

This repository contains a comprehensive practical exploration of core Data Science libraries in Python. The project focuses on efficient data manipulation using NumPy and structured data analysis using Pandas.

## 🚀 Key Learning Objectives
* **NumPy Mastery:** Implementing 1D and 2D arrays, slicing, and memory-efficient data processing.
* **Boolean Indexing:** Filtering complex datasets using logical conditions to extract specific subsets.
* **Pandas Series & DataFrames:** Managing structured data, handling missing values (NaN), and performing axis-level operations.
* **File I/O:** Saving and reloading data in `.npy` (Binary) and `.csv` (Comma Separated) formats.

## 🛠️ Task Breakdown

### Task 1: NdArray & Vectorization
* Compared slicing performance between Python lists and NumPy arrays.
* Developed a 2D "Cast and Movies" matrix system.
* Used **Boolean Indexing** to filter actors based on specific movie criteria.
* Demonstrated data persistence by saving/loading NumPy objects to disk.

### Task 2: Pandas Basics
* Created custom `Series` objects with branded indices.
* Implemented string-based filtering to isolate specific models.
* Re-indexed and cleaned metadata for better readability.

### Task 3: DataFrame Operations
* Engineered a multi-type DataFrame (String, Int, Boolean).
* Handled missing data by programmatically replacing **NaN** values.
* Applied custom functions using the `.apply()` method for complex calculations.
* Performed data sorting and identified extreme values (max/min) within the dataset.

## 💻 Technologies Used
* **Python 3.x**
* **NumPy:** For high-performance numerical calculations.
* **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **Jupyter Notebook:** For interactive development and documentation.
